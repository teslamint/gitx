This is mxcl's GitX

It is designed to be the visual complement to using the command line. The command
line git tool is great. However it is not ideal for:

* Committing
* Viewing the tree

GitX is for those things. Nothing else. Nothing else at all.

Install the command line tool "gitx" (use the GitX Menu) or you will not enjoy
using gitx.
